# 1. Palindrome Number

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


# 2. Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
